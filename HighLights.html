		<p>
			The Winter Wonderland assignment was one of the most enjoyable things of the semester.
			The assignment itself started off as just a regular school assignment, but turned into a full competition between about 4 of us to see who could make the best winter scene.
			Turtle is an add on to python that basically draws out a path depending on where you send it.
			It can’t exactly “jump” from place to place but you can make it not draw as its travelling which is great or else it would have been etch-a-sketch but to the extreme.
			The smoke in the image is actually animated, and the snowflakes as well are animated.
