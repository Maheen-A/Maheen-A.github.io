		     No, I Swear. I'm actually magic. But really, who am I?
				 <br><br>
				 Well some know me as a book worm, others know me as a try hard.
				 I Refer to myself as a nerd; someone who loves Reading, Math, Science and also happens to have artistic talent as well.
				 "She’s good at science <i>and</i> art?!" Yup that’s right. I'm the full package ;)
				 <br><br>
				 All jokes aside though, I'm actually really a high schooler who's working up to get the skills I need to become a Software Engineer.
				 My Days are spent furiously searching up programs, and my nights are spent furiously programming behind my laptop screen.
				 <br><br>
				 I might have a problem. You should send help.
